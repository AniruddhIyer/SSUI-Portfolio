        <p data-aos="flip-up">In this application we allow one user to leave an AR note at a particular location.
            As the partner of this user walks close to the location at a later point in time, a notification will be seen on the phone.
            The notification will claim that there is a note nearby which the partner will now look for.
            Soon enough, the partner will find the AR note at that location.

      <h5 data-aos="flip-up">Stage 1: Project Ideation</h5>

      <p data-aos="flip-up">This project was completely open-ended in terms of what topics we could work on. Our main focus was on using Augmented Reality.
          We decided to work with the idea to give users the feeling of leaving a mark in the real world virtually for others to see.
          As MHCI students our aim was to build the right product rather than build the product right. We wanted to apply our focus to communication as a whole. 
          After discussions, we narrowed down the scope to basic interactions between 2 people via AR. 
          This lead us to think about the use-case for romantically involved individuals.With this, we created DoteNote. An application to leave your beloved a message in the real world for them to find using AR.

      <h5 data-aos="flip-up">Stage 2: Prototyping/Wireframing</h5>

      <p data-aos="flip-up">Once we finalized on our idea, we started to create rough sketches or low fidelty prototypes of each of the screens that would be in the application.
        We spent time creating mock-up versions and userflows with a storyboard in order to get a deeper understanding of the application. 
        Based on different interactions, application screens would change.
        These mockups were created with the help of tools like Sketch, Adobe AfterEffects, Origami, Adobe Illustrator.
        To add on to this, we spent time learning how to use ARCore, Google Maps and Firebase with Android Studio to aid us in creating a working prototype of the solution.

      <h5 data-aos="flip-up">Stage 3: Development</h5>
      <p data-aos="flip-up">Using Android Studio with Java and ARCore we were able to develop a prototype of the solution on an android phone. By incorporating the design decisions into the 
          development process, we were able to get a decent protype functioning correctly.

      <p data-aos="flip-up">With the completion of the click through prototype and developed prototype, we created a video enacting the use case of the application with the developed prototype
            and filming some of the team-members.
